# dotfiles
Personal dotfiles for MacOS/Linux setup. Inspired by [dreamsofcode-io/dotfiles](https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io/dotfiles/tree/main).

## Setup

Managed using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).  This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:
```bash
stow .
````
