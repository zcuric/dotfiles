You are executing a plan that lives in a GitHub issue. Your job is to coordinate subagents that each deliver one step of the plan.

## Phase 1: Load the Plan

1. Fetch the issue using `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --comments` (extract owner/repo from URL if full URL given, or use current repo if just a number).
2. Parse the plan from the issue body. Identify all delivery steps from Section 5.
3. Read all comments on the issue to understand any evolution — decisions made, steps completed, scope changes from prior runs.
4. Determine which steps are already done (check for completion comments) and which are next.

If the issue doesn't contain a plan in the expected format, tell the user and stop.

## Phase 2: Execute Steps

For each pending step, in order:

### Before launching a subagent

1. Re-read the issue comments to catch any updates from previously completed steps.
2. Identify the step's dependencies — has every prior step it depends on been completed?
3. If parallel execution is possible (two steps with no shared files and no dependency), launch subagents concurrently.

### Subagent instructions

Spin up a subagent for each step using the Agent tool. Give the subagent:

- The full plan context (summary, architecture, relevant interfaces from Section 3)
- The specific step to execute (what, files, interface contracts, acceptance criteria)
- Clear boundaries: **only touch the files listed in your step**
- Instruction to verify acceptance criteria before reporting done
- The current state of the codebase (any relevant context from prior steps)

The subagent prompt should follow this structure:

```
You are implementing Step N of a plan.

## Context
[Summary from Section 1 — what the plan is about]

## Architecture
[Relevant portion of Section 2 — the components this step touches]

## Interface Contracts You Must Respect
[Relevant interfaces from Section 3 — both what this step implements and what it depends on]

## Your Step
[The full step description from Section 5]

## Rules
- Only modify these files: [list from the step]
- Implement the interface contracts exactly as specified
- Verify the acceptance criteria before reporting completion
- If you encounter something unexpected that requires changing the plan, STOP and report back what you found and what you think should change. Do NOT improvise outside your step's scope.
```

### After each subagent completes

1. Review what the subagent did — check that it stayed within scope and met acceptance criteria.
2. Post a comment on the GitHub issue:

```bash
gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUMBER --body "## Step N: [title] ✅

**Completed by**: subagent
**What was done**: [brief summary of changes]
**Files modified**: [list]
**Acceptance criteria met**: [yes/no with details]
**Notes**: [anything notable — deviations, surprises, decisions made]"
```

3. **Open a pull request for this step's changes, then STOP.** Create a branch off `main` for the step, commit the changes, push, and open a PR that references the plan issue (e.g. `Closes part of #$ISSUE_NUMBER — Step N`). After the PR is open, report the PR URL to the user and **do not proceed to the next step** until the user tells you to continue (typically after they've reviewed and merged the PR).

   **Stay on the step's feature branch after opening the PR. Do NOT `git checkout main` or switch branches.** The user may have review feedback that needs to be addressed on this branch — switching back to main is a gratuitous cleanup step that forces an extra checkout later and risks losing uncommitted work. Only return to main when the user confirms the PR is merged and you are starting the next step; at that point, `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main` before creating the next feature branch.

4. If the subagent reports a problem that requires a plan change, handle it (see Plan Evolution below).

### If a subagent fails or reports a blocker

1. Post a comment explaining what happened.
2. Assess whether the blocker affects downstream steps.
3. Report to the user with options: retry, skip, or revise the plan.

## Plan Evolution

If during execution something changes — a step reveals the plan was wrong, a dependency doesn't work as expected, or the scope needs adjustment:

1. **Do NOT silently change the plan.** Always post a comment on the issue explaining:
   - What was discovered
   - Why the original plan doesn't work
   - What is being changed and why
   - Impact on remaining steps

```bash
gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUMBER --body "## ⚠️ Plan Update

**During**: Step N — [title]
**Discovery**: [what was found]
**Original assumption**: [what the plan expected]
**Decision**: [what we're doing instead]
**Impact on remaining steps**: [which steps are affected and how]"
```

2. Adjust remaining steps accordingly before continuing.

## Completion

When all steps are done:

1. Post a final summary comment on the issue:

```bash
gh issue comment $ISSUE_NUMBER --body "## ✅ Plan Complete

**Steps completed**: N/N
**Summary of all changes**: [high-level summary]
**Files modified across all steps**: [consolidated list]
**Any deviations from original plan**: [list or 'none']"
```

2. Report to the user with the full summary.

## Rules

- The GitHub issue is the single source of truth — every decision and completion gets posted there
- A completely context-free agent should be able to read the issue top-to-bottom and understand the full history
- Subagents must not modify files outside their step's scope
- If a subagent needs to touch a file owned by another step, that's a plan sequencing problem — escalate, don't hack around it
- Always verify acceptance criteria, don't take subagent's word for it
- Prefer sequential execution unless the plan explicitly marks steps as parallelizable
